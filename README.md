## Code Review 
- Issues
  - Seemed pretty intimidating at first. There is definitely a learning curve but it's not too steep. I had followed Traversy Media's Nuxt JS Crash Course and it helped a ton. 
  - Netlify app not working, was fine earlier. my /admin works and im able to create posts but gives 404 on loading main page/on startup.
  - Unable to create a post under code - Files are still too long. Don't know what's causing it.
- Comments
  - I actually don't understand the collections until I see them fully built. Can't picture what I'm making or the different options I have available to me.
  - I feel like I'm on the right track but I'm lost
